 %clear statement of the problem + reasons for studying it\\
 
Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) have been powerful tools to simulate molecular interactions of surfactants in solvent systems, allowing a deeper understanding of self-assembly process of this sort of material \cite{someone}. Therefore, these structural conformations are specially useful to design bio-inspired silica materials \cite{bioinsp} since with the addition of silica they remain behaving as scaffolds to mesoporous or nanoporous structures that are maintained even after surfactant removal, silica oligomer polymerization and calcination \cite{silica1}.
A vast range of silica materials are examples of this phenomena, such as MCM-41 as reported by \citeA{mcm}, HR \cite{hrib}, MSU-V \cite{msuv} and many others, in which the self-assembly structure depend on the type of surfactant and concentration of the substances involved. Moreover, most of the experimental methods used to obtain data are based on observation and interpretation of final silica structure by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thus initial self-assembled conformations are predicted as a reflex of the final results and little is known about the mechanistic of this process. However, by using MD simulations it is possible to observe and analyse these initial steps of self-assembly and further predict, with more accuracy, properties and framework provided by surfactant \cite{lipid} to generate silica structures.

%  background discussion\\
%  what has been done by others(cite works)\\
A major concern is that even though MD uses sophisticated software prepared to simulate enormous systems with thousands of atoms, using all capacities of hardware available, such as high-speed multi-core processors in conjunction with GPUs designed specifically to process data from arrays \cite{gromacs}, they hardly can achieve long time horizons and are commonly limited to a few $\mu s$ depending on the size of the system. For this reason, several techniques have been develop to optimize the performance of the simulations such as coarse-grain models \cite{someone}. Briefly, the idea behind using this technique is to fit parameters of heavy atoms groups with similar properties in a bigger "bead", which includes atomic masses and electrostatic charges lumped in approximated values. For example, by merging carbon heavy atoms, that means carbon atom and its hydrogen atoms, in a lipid tail in groups of three or four since they have similar hydrophobic properties. 

In order to provide a topologies to GROMACS simulations several force-fields, for exemple MARTINI \cite{martini}, use Lennard-Jones potentials fitted to a range of pre-defined bead types. Furthermore, not only intramolecular beads are possible, but also intermolecular beads can be specified, such as multiple solvent molecules merged in a single bead or ions surround by water molecules.

%  how mine differs from the others\\
%  how it relates to the others\\
Moreover, previous works conducted by \cite{mjsilica} with a coarse-grained model of surfactant in presence of silica with explicit water were successful in describe rod-like structures detected on MCM-41 materials, demonstrating the capacities of up-scaling this type of systems.

 Nevertheless, a implicit solvent scheme might exhibit similar behaviour since DMDD is to a certain extent a similar surfactant, although for this work variations on PH of solvent media are not considered.

%  significance of the work\\
%  scope of the work\\
%  limts of the work\\
The work presented on following experiments are an attempt to create a cross-link method to upscale silica crystal-liquid phase interactions \cite{silica1} from the atomistic model to a mesoscale model with the advent of coarse-grain technique. The methodology applied to reach the desired model is based on work previously done by \citeA{dmpc} which introduced the MagiC software package \cite{magic} that in conjunction MD simulation software, in this case GROMACS \cite{gromacs}, will provide a suitable approximation to self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules in presence of silica. Further explanations of the process are described on Experimental Methods section. 

For the scope of this project, a bolaamphiphilic molecule 1,12-diaminododecane (DMDD) has been chosen as surfactant because that as seen in previous research by \citeA{msuv} it self-assembly in multilamelar vesicles that in presence of a silica precursor is capable of generating a mesoporous structure with remarkable properties. In order to validate this structure formation and further framework formation for silica oligomers, a coarse-grain approximation is suitable option since amphiphilic molecules interaction with solvents can be described efficiently with Lennard-Jones potentials interactions. Even though using an implicit solvent, interaction potentials generated from a bottom-up approach are applicable for a coarse-grain model \cite{dmpc}. It is supposed  that thermodynamic changes on the system, originated from solvent interaction with amphiphilic molecules, are incorporated on the approximated potentials. Therefore, changes in parameters as concentration may not affect coarse-grained model performance on recreating self-assembly structures.  As a final objective at the end of this project, a implicit water coarse-grain model for DMDD will be generated and properly validated based on MD simulations and thermodynamic properties,in order to provide a good approximation to interactions with silica oligomers in a mesoscale model.

\subsection{Methods Description} 
The experimental process of this project is divided in 3 main parts: Firstly, develop a efficient coarse-grain model and validate its use. Secondly, analyse the relationship between concentration  of all-atoms simulation and concentration of coarse-grained simulation. Then finally, create and reproduce a Silica surfactant mesoscale system. 

In order to maintain standard parameters for all GROMACS simulations, all-atoms simulations that were used for coarse-grained reference were run in NPT ensemble. All simulation boxes were created using genbox (GROMACS package utility), first by inserting the desired number of surfactant molecules and then adding the solvent at the adequate ratio. The molecules were designed based on OPLS-AA forcefield \cite{opls} parameters, %because?%
therefore the surfactant DMDD was created with aid of co-workers and water type was TIP4P \cite{tip4p}. %because?% 
Moreover, no initial configuration was determined, such as a pre self-assembled system, to ensure stochastic nature of the system.  

Initially, all boxes received a energy minimization step in order to avoid system blow-up deal to possible extreme potential energy spots created during box generation, because due to random displacement of molecules some of them could overlap others and then cause a destabilization of the system. After, an equilibration step was necessary to reach desired initial temperature and pressure conditions for the MD simulation. During equilibration temperature coupling was kept as $298$ $K$ using a v-rescaling thermostat \cite{vthermostat} with time constant of $0.01$ $ps$ and pressure coupling was kept at $1$ $bar$ using a Berendsen barostat \cite{bbarostat} with time constant of $0.5$  $ps$.

In order to avoid electrostatic interactions on the IMC process and further simulation the heavy atoms groups (heavy atom + hydrogen) were kept thus  final charge remain unchanged in each bead}
